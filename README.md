## How does it work?
This website runs locally on the user's PC and uses python (flask) to scrape data off of the internet, as well as local json files, to return type matchups of certain TemTem based on the user's input.

## How do I install?
1. Install Python (3.8).
2. Open terminal in extracted folder.
3. Run the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open the file: `run_temtype.py` 
    - The cmd window will immediately close, this is normal.
5. Open `127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser and enjoy!
